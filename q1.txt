Congratulations, you now know enough to start 
collaborating on Git projects! Let's review.

A remote is a Git repository that lives outside your
Git project folder. Remotes can live on the web, on 
a shared network or even in a separate folder on 
your local computer.The Git Collaborative Workflow 
are steps that enable smooth project development 
when multiple collaborators are working on the same 
Git project.
